Welcome to my _Learning notes_

This is a page for sharing things I learned during grad school, for anyone who might benefit from it.

- It is your second brain üß†, stored in future-proof Markdown files 
- Supports audio, video, images, math, code, [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) diagrams, and [much more](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/)
- Edit your notes online in GitHub, or any Git-connected Markdown app such as [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://vscode.dev/)

## Public vs Private Second Brain

Choose between **publishing and sharing your knowledge online or creating a private second brain**.

To create an **open second brain**, share your knowledge with others [by deploying this template](https://wowchemy.com/hugo-themes/) as a public website.

To create a **private second brain** either:

- After deploying your site above, [password protect your online second brain](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/password-protection/) and configure your GitHub repo as **private**
- [Download this template](https://github.com/wowchemy/hugo-second-brain-theme) and [run the tool locally](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/)
